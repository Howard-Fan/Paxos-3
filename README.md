Introduction

You are given a string composed of only 1s, 0s, and Xs.

Write a program that will print out every possible combination where you replace the X with both

0 and 1.

Example

$ myprogram X0

00

10

$ myprogram 10X10X0

1001000

1001010

1011000

1011010

While your program will take longer to run based on the number of possible combinations, your

program shouldnâ€™t crash (or hang) on an input with many Xs.

What is the big O notation for your program?
Let the number of Xs be N. The program runs on O(2^N) time
